  <summary> <em><strong> Itteration 1 Specifications and Proffesor Assinged Objectives </strong></em> </summary>
  <h3> Iteration 1</h3>
  <h4> Document: </h4>  
Software requirements specification (for all user stories). Each team will
be responsible to independently refine the user stories into software requirements. (Your
team is your customer.)
  <h4> Use Case: </h4>
For your team work in this course, you should aim to have at least one use case per team
member. <strong>However, for the first increment, you should decide on three basic use cases that
can be implemented in one week.</strong>
  <h4> Lab Goals: </h4>
<strong>Laboratory Week 4</strong>: Present your working version of the system for iteration 1. The
team meeting should review what needs to be done over the next week to get the application
ready for submission; the team should review status of the document, and review
the timeline overall for iteration 1, assigned tasks and deadlines, for both the software
and the document to be ready for submission.<br/><br/>
 <strong>Tutorial Week 5: Laboratory Week 5:</strong> Last minute scrum to resolve remaining work
for software and document submission. Do not forget to write minutes of meetings and
individual diaries, and place these on the repository under version control. Do not forget
to submit software, document, diary. Submit to EAS under required category: Documents
should be submitted as “project 1”; Source code as “programming assignment 1”; diary
as “theory assignment 1”.
Submission at end of Week 5.<br/><br/>
<strong>Personal Study Week 5 and 6: </strong>Review course material for Quiz 1. Pay particular
attention to how the lectures relate to your project work. Web page should have questions
to guide your study. Review what you covered in tutorials for Iteration 1: domain model,
use cases, TDD, MVC.

  <summary> <em><strong> Itteration 2 Specifications and Proffesor Assinged Objectives </strong></em> </summary>
  <h3> Iteration 2 </h3>
  <h4>Document:</h4>
  Architectural and detailed design specification (for all user stories)<br><br>
  <h4> Lab Goals: </h4>
<strong>Laboratory Week 6:</strong> Team meeting to celebrate submission of Iteration 1; discuss rotation
of roles for Iteration 2; select use cases for Iteration 2; and agree on task assignments,
deadlines, and overall timeline. Possible de-brief on what worked well and what did not
work well on Iteration 1. Possible plan to fix any remaining issues in software for Iteration
1.
<strong>Laboratory Week 7:</strong> Documenters should review Latex and create a sample document.
Coders should review JUnit and create sample unit tests. The team should meet and
resolve any misunderstandings for Iteration 2 about the domain model and use cases;
hear how the Coders plan to implement their assigned use case; hear what issues the
Documenters have, and what content/information they need. Everyone can help create
sample data for person X as needed by the unit tests. Review the timeline overall for
iteration 2, assigned tasks and deadlines.
<strong>Laboratory Week 8:</strong> Present your working version of the system for iteration 2. The
team meeting should review what needs to be done over the next week to get the application
ready for submission; the team should review status of the document, and review
the timeline overall for iteration 2, assigned tasks and deadlines, for both the software
and the document to be ready for submission.
