### LaTeX
Documentation is to be generated using the LaTeX system.<br/>
Asuming you have no idea where to start... The following are some introductory information on how to generate LaTeX that I used for 353's E/R diagrams using TeX Studio, tikv, and ulem. Tex Studio has a built in package installer for your use.<br/>
__Alternatively, for a web based solution to rendering diagrams [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) does package installation for you and doesn't require you to install anything.__<br/>
These links only serve an introductory purpose. LaTeX is highly developed langauge with many packages more suited to your goals than what is presented.
