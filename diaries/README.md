# Guide on Markdown(.md) Formatting

* .md is a markdown language that adds formatting to your text files when viewing them in github. 
* It can mostly be done in \<html> if you're more comfortable with that.
* It's much prettier than text files so whoever is reading our repository won't have their eyes bleed when going through an entire section of student's daily logs.
* It allows you to write readme files on github that appear at the bottom of directory pages such as the one you're reading now.
