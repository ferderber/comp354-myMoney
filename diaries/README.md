## Guide on Markdown(.md) Formatting

* .md is a markup language that adds formatting to your text files when viewing them in github. 
* It can mostly be done in \<html> if you're more comfortable with that.
* It's much prettier than .txt files so whoever is grading our repository won't have their eyes bleed when going through an entire section of student's daily logs.
* It allows you to write readme files on github that appear at the bottom of directory pages such as the one you're reading now.
* The <a href = "https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md">mardown-cheatsheet</a> at the bottom tells you everything you need to know.
