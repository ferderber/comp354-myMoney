After the my team created all the repositories and files for the project, as well as the roles were discussed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Setup Eclipse and all related software for development,
\item Downloaded the repo with a project code, written by Matthew,
\item Started reading the documentation for JAVAFX.
\end{itemize}

Written classes for the Account, Account enity management (AccountDao), Account controller in analogue with existing Transaction classes. Made simple GUI testing for those.

\subsection*{February 2}
Rewritten controller, created different controllers for List of Accounts and Single. Encountered several bugs.


\subsection*{February 6}

Spent most of the day in parallel with work trying solve the errors with compiling my code. Installed Scene Builder and bunch of other software. Learned few tricks about case sensitivity of the JvaFX library and fxml documents. Merged code with a current code version.
