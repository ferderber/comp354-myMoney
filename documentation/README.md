# MyMoney Documentation
## The Documenter's Challenge
The __documenter__ is responsible for developing the _documentation_ for the increment including ___diagrams___ and ___ensuring the documentation complies with the project as a
whole___. Note that the content for the document is the __joint responsibility of the team__. Documents will be done using _Latex_.
## Description
### LaTeX
Documentation is to be generated using the LaTeX system.<br/>
Asuming you have no idea where to start... The following are some introductory information on how to generate LaTeX that I used for 353's E/R diagrams using TeX Studio, tikv, and ulem. Tex Studio has a built in package installer for your use.<br/>
__Alternatively, for a web based solution to rendering diagrams [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) does package installation for you and doesn't require you to install anything.__
